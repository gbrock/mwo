# Middleware Organizer
A [Laravel](http://laravel.com) project intended to be used as a sample when
building applications.  Once complete, it should include the basics for getting
apps launched quickly.

- extended Auth (via Sentry), linked to the Address Book
    - UI for login, registration, and account management
    - UI for managing groups and permissions
- a simplified asset pipeline for rendering LESS/JavaScript files
- Base Model and Validation Trait eases CRUD operations
- Revisionable (revision history) and Staplerable (associate uploaded file data)
available to models
- Admin dashboard for managing content
- Notifications, Breadcrumbs, and Menus implemented
- Debugbar installed and available
- Uses Bootstrap 3 and FontAwesome
- No JavaScript (subject to change in the future)
